## ¿Qué es un proyecto?
Algo que tiene un objetivo, un principio y un fin.

## Requirement Fundamentals
- __Requirements__: Are what the product is meant to do and to be. Exist whether you discover them or not.
- Your product will never be right unless it conforms to the requirements.
- Requirements are not about the written requirements as such, but rather an uncovering of the problem to be solved.
- Requirements, if they are to be dimplemented succesfully, must be measurable and testable.

### Requirements Life Cycle
1. Elicitation

## Requirement Gathering 
This activity is traditionally seen as somewhat akin to the task of a stenographer. That is, the business analyst listens carefully to the stakeholders, records precisely whatever it is they say, and translates their requests into requirements for the product.


### Requirement discovery:
- Is not principally about writing a requirements document.
- It focuses on understanding a business problem and providing a solution for it.
- Software is built to solve problem.
- The real art of requirements discovery is discovering the real problem.

## Well Defined Requirement Importance
Many problems in the software would arise from shortcomings in the ways that people learn about, document, agree upon and modify the product's requirements.

Common problem areas are:
- informal information gathering.
- implied functionality.
- miscommunicated assumptions.
- poorly specified requirements.
- and a casual change process.

Various studies suggest that errors introduced during requirements activities account for 40 to 50 percent of all defects found in a software product.
